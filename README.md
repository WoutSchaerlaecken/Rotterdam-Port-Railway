# Rotterdam-Port-Railway

This is a small program used to analyse and optimize the station locations within a metro/rail network. In order to analyse a metro network, input all the variables and create the network by using the stations, connections, and metro_lines classes in 'Inputs.py'. Running the 'Main.py' should provide a map of the network together with the traveltime between specified stations. 

Note that the program is very simplified and has its limitations. It does for example not take into account possible delays, or even the time table of the network.
